Grant,606010,Scott,12/28/2015,18,12/29/2015,Winter Storm,101309,"A very large storm system that began in the southern Rockies on Sunday, December 27th, moved out into the southern Plains, and slowly moved north-northeast toward the Great Lakes region by Tuesday morning, December 29th. ||Copious amounts of deep gulf moisture moved northward in advance of this system creating large areas of precipitation across the Mid-Mississippi Valley region early Monday, December 28th. ||Initially the atmosphere was dry and kept most of the precipitation south of the Iowa border through 9 AM LST. Slowly a band of snow moved into far southern Minnesota by noon, and spread northward across south central and into east central Minnesota by the late afternoon. Snowfall rates increased to 1-2 inches per hour across far southern Minnesota and produced locally 6 to 7 inches from Fairmont to Wells, Waseca and north of Albert Lea by 7 PM LST. By 8 to 9 PM LST, areas from near Mankato to Owatonna received locally 6 inches of snow. As this band moved northward toward the southern part of the Twin Cities metro area, snowfall rates decreased, but a quick 2 to 5 inches fell from New Ulm to St. Peter, New Prague and Lakeville by 11 PM LST. This band of snow began to weaken and dissipate over the Twin Cities by midnight. ||Another area of light snow developed across southern Minnesota after 3 AM LST, and slowly drifted east-northeast and produced an additional 2 to 4 inches from Mankato to Owatonna, Jordon, Prior Lake to Lakeville and southern Washington County. This area of snow moved into west central Wisconsin before dissipating during the late afternoon of Tuesday, December 29th.  ||Total snowfall amounts by the time the snowfall ended or became occasional flurries, ranged from 10 to 12 inches around Fairmont, Winnebago, Mankato, Waseca and Northfield, to 6 to 10 inches from New Ulm, Jordan and Lakeville. Snowfall amounts across the Twin Cities metro area ranged from 6 to 10 inches in the far southern suburbs, to around 1 to 2 inches around Elk River, Anoka to Forest Lake on the north side of the cities.||Snowfall amounts in west central Wisconsin ranged from 3 to 6 inches from Hudson to Menomonie and Eau Claire, to around an inch near Osceola, Rice Lake and Ladysmith."
Polk,610886,Hennepin,2/2/2016,12,2/2/2016,Winter Storm,102020,"A major winter storm affected the Upper Midwest with snowfall amounts in excess of one foot around the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area that fell during the afternoon and evening of Tuesday, February 2nd.  ||This storm system began to organize in the central Rockies Monday, February, 1st with heavy snowfall along the lee of the Rockies, and out into the Central Plains by Monday afternoon. This area of snow continued to move east-northeast across the plains, and into the Upper Midwest by Tuesday morning, February 2nd.  Snow started to fall heavily along the Iowa, Minnesota border Tuesday morning before 9 AM CST, and then moved northward, and affected the southern half of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area by noon. ||Snowfall rates increased to over one inch per hour as a heavy snow band moved northward across southern Minnesota.  Observed snowfall amounts of 3-6 inches fell near Albert Lea, Fairmont, and Mankato before 2 PM CST with this heavy snowfall band. This heavier snow band started to set up across the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area area by the early afternoon.  Plus, this snow band held nearly steady for 3 hours or more from north of Mankato, to the southern part of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, northeast into portions of west central Wisconsin.  This band eventually moved far enough to the northwest to produced several inches of snow from near Hutchinson, northeast to Buffalo, then east to southern Anoka County, and far southern Chisago County.  ||Due to a more northwest shift of this system as it moved out into the plains, and Upper Midwest, drier air was able to move into far south central Minnesota, which kept snowfall totals in this area lower than expected. This area also received some freezing drizzle and sleet as warmer air aloft managed to move further to the north. ||As this system moved from southwest Iowa Tuesday evening, to southern Wisconsin by Wednesday morning, February 3rd, snowfall began to taper off after midnight. Lingering light snow slowly moved out of eastern Minnesota by late Wednesday morning. ||There were major impacts with this storm including numerous county roads and highways in southwest and south central Minnesota closed. This is based on the Minnesota Department of Transportation web site which indicated areas south and west of the Twin Cities had snow covered roads, travel not recommended or closed. This including I-90 west of Albert Lea by 2 PM CST Tuesday due to car accidents and whiteout conditions. Road closures were confined to areas south and west of Mankato to Owatonna, and Albert Lea. ||Other impacts included the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, which had 175 flights canceled or delayed by as much as five hours. With high winds and low visibility, flight cancellations and delays escalated through the afternoon and into the evening. In addition, the airport, which normally operates three of its four runways, was down to two during the storm, and sometimes down to one, as plow drivers worked to keep up with the snow.||Total snowfall across the area by Wednesday morning ranged from...||10 to 13 inches across Carver, Hennepin, Scott, Dakota, Washington and Ramsey Counties of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, to 6 to 10 inches from Fairmont, north to Mankato, Gaylord, Glencoe, Buffalo, northeast to Anoka and Wyoming. Outside of this area, snowfall amounts decreased rapidly to 1-4 inches, with some areas only receiving a trace or less in portions of west central and central Minnesota."
Dana,662543,Carver,12/10/2016,12,12/11/2016,Winter Storm,111012,"A storm system began to develop across the Plains and into the Upper Midwest Saturday morning, December 10th. Initially, a dry air mass to the north kept the onset of light snow confined to the Minnesota, Iowa border through noon. By the afternoon, the area of light snow slowly expanded northeast across southern Minnesota, and far west central Wisconsin. ||Although the light snow continued through the late afternoon across southern Minnesota, snowfall amounts were light and averaging under 1-2 inches in a 6-12 hour period. By the late afternoon and early evening, a band of heavier snowfall developed across far southern Minnesota between Redwood Falls, and Faribault. This band of snow slowly moved northward and held relatively stationary through the evening, and overnight hours before tapering off Sunday morning. This band generated snowfall rates of 1/2 to 1 inch per hour and caused a small area of snowfall amounts between 6 to 10 inches from west central, to southeast Minnesota. The heaviest occurred near Redwood Falls and Granite Falls, with a secondary area of 8 to 10 inches near New Prague and Montgomery. The snow tapered off from west to east Sunday morning after 9 am, and by early afternoon most of the snow had ended with only flurries reported.||A few counties in southern Minnesota had between 6-8 inches of snow by midnight, Sunday, December 11th in a 12 hour period, as most of the snow began Saturday morning.  Totals of 8 to 10 inches fell in a 24 hour period across the rest of southern Minnesota as a few inches occurred Saturday, with the bulk of the snowfall between 9 pm and 9 am.||The heaviest snowfall from this storm include:||Redwood Falls 12.1 inches.|Montgomery 11 inches.|Granite Falls 10 inches|Canby 10 inches."
Ferry,662658,Hennepin,12/16/2016,15,12/17/2016,Winter Storm,111065,"A long duration snow storm that occurred from early Friday morning through Saturday morning, December 17th, produced mostly 3 to 6 inches of snow across southern Minnesota. A few bands of moderate snowfall during the late afternoon into Friday evening, produced isolated 6 to 7 inch amounts across southern Minnesota in a 12 hour period. Snowfall amounts tapered off northward across central Minnesota, which received between 1 to 3 inches of snow. Only two areas received isolated 6 to 7 inches between Friday afternoon through early Saturday morning. One area was along the Iowa, Minnesota border where a consistent moderate snow band held for a few hours. Another band of moderate snow held across portions of east central Minnesota where locally 5 to 7 inches fell around the Twin Cities metro area."

A swath of heavy snow fell from south central, into east central Minnesota, as well as portions of west central Wisconsin Monday, January 22nd. The heaviest snow fell along a line from south central Minnesota, near St. James, northeast to the southern part of the Twin Cities Metro area, and into west central Wisconsin near Hudson, Rice Lake and Ladysmith. Snowfall amounts over 8 inches occurred in this band, with localized one foot totals near St. James, Jordan, Prior Lake, and St. Paul, Minnesota. Another heavier band of snow with amounts of over a foot occurred from Waseca, Owatonna, Faribault and Cannon Falls, Minnesota. There was also a very sharp cutoff on where the snow fell, and reports several inches, to only a trace in a 25 mile band on the northwest side of the storm system. In addition to the snowfall, strong winds developed in southern Minnesota, with gusts of 35 to 45 mph at times from New Ulm, to St. Peter and Owatonna, south to the Iowa border. The Minnesota Department of Transportation indicated by 9 am that numerous roads were nearly impassable, and travel was not recommended (MNDOT Graphical Map) across the Blizzard warned area. ||Some of the higher totals include;||17 inches at Winnebago, |16.6 inches in Prior Lake, |16 inches in Fairmont, |16 inches in Owatonna, |16 inches in Nerstrand. ||Travel was significantly impacted with travel times more than tripled during the afternoon rush hour. From the MN State Patrol, statewide from midnight to 8:45 pm, Monday the 22nd of January, there were 231 crashes, 14 with injuries, 1 serious, but 0 fatal. 560 flights into and out of MSP airport had been cancelled and another 114 delayed. At one point, the airport closed due to snowfall rates more than 1.5 inches per hour. A spokeperson at the airport indicated that during the day there were at least two occasions where all four runways had to be shut down for several hours.  |Portions of I-35 was closed for a time between Owatonna and Faribault."

The first wave of light snow moved across southwest, west central, and central Minnesota during the morning, but most areas only received a light dusting with some sleet noted along the Iowa border. By the afternoon, the snow had spread across the rest of southern Minnesota, and into western Wisconsin. ||During the mid to late afternoon, the snowfall became heavier in Minnesota, and pivoted to the east-northeast before tapering off during the evening in eastern Minnesota. ||Snowfall amounts varied across central, and southern Minnesota, with the heavier bands from near New Ulm in south central Minnesota, northeast to the western suburbs of the Twin Cities, and into west central Wisconsin around Osceola, and St. Croix Falls. Farther to the south and southeast across Minnesota, especially along the Iowa border, the mixture of sleet and freezing rain during the day, kept snowfall amounts much lower than expected. Most areas that had a mixture of sleet and freezing rain received between 3 and 5 inches of snow. Elsewhere, more snow led to higher totals. ||Another area of heavier snowfall occurred from Alexandria, eastward into Todd and Morrison Counties of central Minnesota during the afternoon, and early evening. ||Some of the heavier totals included:||9.0 Inches near Princeton and Orrock in Sherburne County. |9.0 Inches near St. Francis in Anoka County. |9.0 Inches near Alexandria in Douglas County. |8.0 Inches near New Germany & Norwood/Young America in Carver County.|8.0 Inches near Cambridge in Isanti County. |8.0 Inches near Hutchinson in McLeod County.|8.0 Inches near Gaylord in Sibley County."
Howe,740083,Hennepin,4/13/2018,21,4/15/2018,Winter Storm,123370,"A prolonged snow storm event with historic snowfall totals for the month of April, started Friday, April 13th, and lasted until late Sunday night April 15th. ||This event was split into several different precipitation hazards, which created concerns with communicating the impacts of sleet, snow, blowing snow and blizzard conditions. As the event unfolded, this storm began apparent that it would produce record snowfall amounts, along with the highest snowfall amounts so far into the month of April. Therefore, the wording changed from significant/severe winter storm, to historic. ||The first part of the storm developed early Friday morning with bands of showers, and embedded thunderstorms moving northward along the Iowa border. Severe storms were noted south of the Iowa border, with one report of severe winds that occurred in far southwest Minnesota near Magnolia. These storms moved northward into colder air aloft and produced widespread areas of sleet, small hail, but no severe storms. However, there were numerous reports across southern Minnesota where the small hail, and sleet accumulated up to 2 inches in depth. ||Several automated airport observing sites (ASOS/AWOS) reported heavy rainfall, sleet and thunderstorms through the morning, and into the afternoon for the southern 1/4 of the state. By the late morning, and into the afternoon, surface temperatures cooled in west central Minnesota where the precipitation changed over to snow.  As the precipitation moved further north into central Minnesota, the precipitation changed over to snow. A few locations reported moderate to heavy snowfall where locally 2 to 4 inches fell in a short period of time west of St. Cloud, Minnesota. ||The next round of precipitation was in the form of sleet and heavy rain in far southern Minnesota, with snow to the north in the evening. Most of this area of precipitation quickly moved off to the east, with a lull period until early Saturday morning with the main bands of heavy snowfall developed in southwest, and into west central and east central Minnesota by noon. ||Total amounts through Saturday morning ranged from locally 6 inches in west central Minnesota, to an average of 1 to 3 inches from Redwood Falls through the Twin Cities, and into west central Wisconsin near Eau Claire. There was also a band of 2 to 4 inches that fell early Friday afternoon in central Minnesota. South of the Minnesota River valley, only trace amounts were noted, with some icy spots due to overnight sleet and patchy freezing rain. ||By late Saturday morning, and into Saturday afternoon, the snowfall intensified and areal coverage widened across southern and central Minnesota, and into west central Wisconsin. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour were common by the afternoon before the heaviest snowfall began to taper off late Saturday evening. ||The second round, and the third round of precipitation, occurred with the main storm system moving across Iowa and into the Great Lakes region late Saturday night, through late Sunday evening. After Saturday afternoon, snowfall intensity varied with some waves of heavy snowfall from Saturday night, and into Friday afternoon, but the majority of the snow was light.||The worst conditions occurred early Saturday morning, through Saturday afternoon in terms of high end impacts. Strong northeast winds developed in the morning and held in the 25 to 35 mph range, with gusts of 40 to 50 mph through the afternoon and early evening. At times, surface visibility was only a few hundred feet in open country.  The strong winds also combined with the higher snowfall rates, to create blizzard conditions across most of southern Minnesota, west of Interstate 35. Even the inner core of the Twin Cities had visibility so low and strong winds that a blizzard warning was issued. This was the first blizzard warning issued for the Twin Cities Metro area since the blizzard of April 14, 1983. This blizzard grounded flights at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport for over seven hours Saturday, caused over 600 car accidents, nearly 1200 spin-outs, and approximately 20 jackknifed semi trailers. The storm also collapsed the 77-foot-high dome of the Vadnais Sports Center, and forced three consecutive Minnesota Twins home games to be postponed for the first time since Target Field opened. The storm caused the Minnesota Department of Transportation to close several county roads in west central, southwest and south central Minnesota Saturday morning, with Interstate 90 closed by noon, west of Blue Earth. ||From Friday through Sunday morning, According to the state patrol, more than 50 injuries were reported from Friday through Sunday morning, two of which were listed as serious. One death occurred when a man in Medina ran across a highway and was struck by a vehicle.||Conditions slowly improved during the evening, but bands of snow continued. The wind speeds continued to weaken, but strong enough to create areas of blowing snow, with brief periods of whiteout condition in open country.||As the storm ended, the following are some records from this storm. ||15.8 inches of snowfall at the Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport. This was the heaviest April snowstorm on record. It was also the 12th-heaviest snowstorm on record for any month. Plus, the airport had individual maximum snowfall totals on the day on the 15th and 16th. Additionally, by holding temperatures to the 20s or very low 30s during Saturday and Sunday, the storm enabled St. Cloud, and the Twin Cities to break records for the lowest high temperature of the day.||The following snowfall totals were the highest in the state. ||21.4 inches near Madison.|20.5 inches near Victoria. |20.5 inches near Montevideo.|20.2 inches near North St. Paul.|20.0 inches near Dawson.|19.9 inches near downtown Minneapolis.|19.6 inches near St Bonifacius."

Quincy,795022,Scott,1/27/2019,18,1/28/2019,Winter Storm,132799,"Initially, the morning of Sunday, January 27th, a ridge of high pressure was centered across the Upper Midwest. This ridge moved southeast with an area of low pressure developing over Alberta, Canada, and diving southeast across the Dakotas Sunday afternoon, and over northern Iowa, and northern Illinois through Sunday night/Monday morning.||This was a typical Alberta Clipper which raced southeast, with an initial very dry air mass over the Upper Midwest. Thus, moisture content was low, the speed was high, and the atmosphere had to moisten up before snow reached the surface. In addition, the forcing weakened during the afternoon, and evening across southern Minnesota, before intensifying across Wisconsin Sunday night. ||These factors limited snowfall amounts with narrow bands of 6 to 8 inches of snow across southern Minnesota, and portions of west central Wisconsin. The heavier amounts, or greater than 8 inches, occurred in southeast Minnesota, and into southern Wisconsin. There were also a few locations in central Minnesota, before the system weakened some, that received 6 to 7 inches of snow from Alexandria to Long Prairie. ||The following are some of the heavier snowfall amounts:||7.2 inches in Ellendale.|7.2 inches in Owatonna.|7 inches in Mankato.|6.5 inches near Faribault."

Over the Upper Midwest, there was an elongated, inverted trough that focused the precipitation across the Upper Midwest during the morning, and afternoon of Thursday February 7th. Once this system moved rapidly northeast over the Great Lakes region, and pressure rises occurred across the Upper Midwest, strong gusty winds developed and caused blizzard conditions in parts of Minnesota. ||The initial bands of precipitation developed over southern Minnesota during the predawn hours with a mixture of sleet, freezing rain and snow. There was already a coating of ice from a long duration of freezing drizzle the night before. The mixture of sleet, freezing rain, and snow quickly changed over to all snow after sunrise. ||Snowfall intensified in the morning, with amounts of 4 to 6 inches already reported in portions of central and east central Minnesota before noon. The snowfall continued through the afternoon, and tapered off in the evening. The heaviest snowfall occurred between 7 AM CST, to 2 PM CST. ||As winds began to increase during the afternoon, visibility dropped significantly in western Minnesota. By the mid to late afternoon, several roads closed as blowing snow kept snowplows off the road. In addition, the governor of Minnesota activated the National Guard for blizzard assistance in Renville County due to white-out conditions and stranded motorists.||Between 330 PM and 930 PM Thursday, February, 7th, the Minnesota State Patrol reported 149 crashes, 294 spin-outs and 19 jack knifed trucks in portions of west central, and northwest Minnesota."
